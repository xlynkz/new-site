# Executive Summary

Fastur allows clients to build, host and manage internet businesses.

The product consists of a content management system, which runs on a web hosting service and features a plug-in architecture for extensions and templates. Fastur.com can be used by anyone with an internet connection and a browser.

The problem is that application development is complex and expensive. Designing, developing, and testing an application can have a monthly cost of $30,000 and take 6 months to prepare for launch. Development costs do not end after launching and often increase as business growth necessitates further development.

Fastur reduces the time, cost and complexity associated with venture development. Fastur puts the power of artificial intelligence and natural language understanding behind a content management system to become an intelligent website builder. Through our efforts we will set a new standard in venture creation.

4. Market Research

4.1 - Client Research

Our customers consist of founders and managers of website companies. Specifically, Fastur is creating value for high growth software companies which are termed “startups”.

Some startups serve consumer markets while others target enterprise customers. The industries that startups operate in can vary a lot. That being said, the founders of these companies share many of the same problems and the internet products that power their businesses require much of the same in functionality and features.

These founders are our most important customers. They are scattered across the world and tend to live in metropolitan areas. They are supported by Incubators accelerators, co-working spaces and seed-stage Investment firms, all of which tend to be concentrated in downtown metropolitan areas.

Founders attend startup events which bring together entrepreneurs, developers and investors with the goal of cultivating an entrepreneurial culture. These events are the main meeting places for entrepreneurs to gather and share ideas while exposing themselves to people with similar interests.

Our typical customer is computer literate and under 40 years of age. The problems that these founders have which Fastur could solve are application development, hosting and management.

4.2 - Competitor Profiling
Fastur faces strategic competitors from content management systems (CMS) and application programming interface (API) tools.

1st competitor | Wordpress.org and Wordpress.com

Wordpress is open source and currently holds nearly 60% of the CMS market. WordPress leads other CMS’s because of its ease of use. Currently, 20% of daily domain activations run WordPress in the US. WordPress features a plugin architecture for extending functionality and a theming architecture for customizable front-end designs.

Strengths:

Wordpress.com is the best option for users who do not want to tackle anything technical.

Wordpress.org offers full control of a site. Plugins allow users to create many kinds of websites, from ecommerce and subscription to auction and gallery sites.  Wordpress.org allows control on performance and monetization methods.

Weaknesses:

Wordpress.com does not allow custom plugins or custom themes. The site does not offer FTP access nor can users download the source code. Wordpress.org developers are fragmented and plugins are often out of date, buggy, bloated or unsecure.

Cost

Wordpress.com operates under a freemium model. The free package entails free hosting with 3GB of storage space. A custom domain name is provided by WordPress for 13$/year. Users can pay $30/year to remove ads and $60/year to include videos.

Wordpress.org is free to download. To utilize the software users will need to rent a server and purchase a domain name which averages to $100/year.

Comparison

Wordpress.com users cannot extend their site functionality in any meaningful way; the service is essentially a hosted blogging tool. Wordpress.org does allow extended functionality but again the software was created with blogging in mind and its user base consists of bloggers, individual store owners and client businesses such as event management web design consultancies.

Fastur.com users will be able to extend functionality without seeing a line of code yet still retain the option to download their source for individual development and backup. Fastur.com users will be able to build data driven businesses and offer their users native support without contracting a developer. Unlike WordPress, users of Fastur will be able to build complicated applications that interact with external service providers. Lastly, Users of Fastur can build applications that are scalable while maintaining product integrity suitable for the enterprise market.

In short, WordPress was created to primarily manage content; Fastur is being created to make data productive.


2nd Competitor | Apigee.com

Apigee.com is an API management platform that gives enterprises the tools to make their backend services and data available for consumption by web and mobile applications.

Strengths:

Gateway Services -- API proxy, security, transformation, etc.
App Services -- "back end as a service" for application builders
Developer Channel -- tools and portals for API providers to give their developers
Analytics Services -- analytics on the API traffic and other stuff.

Weaknesses

The platform must be used by a developer. It is created to extend the functionality of current systems and is not a standalone service.

Cost

Apigee.com is free to use for developers. Enterprise plans begin at $9000/month and vary based on usage.

Comparison

Apigee.com is purely an API as a service company and its tools are focused on the developer. Fastur.com features its API as a core feature of its software development capacities. Further, Fastur.com is developer friendly but targets the average person.

4.3 - SWOT Analysis

Strengths
○	The founder has a background in web development and has worked with every major content management system. Critically, the founder is building a tool that he would use.

○	Deep domain knowledge driven by an insatiable appetite for information regarding the happenings of the web economy.

Weaknesses
○	As a new enterprise, Fastur does not have brand recognition. To achieve our mission our users must have unwavering confidence in our infrastructure. To build a brand of reliability, Fastur will operate under a service level agreement (SLA) which guarantees an availability of 99.95%. To build a brand of security, Fastur will authenticate itself with McAfee and attain a SSL certificate from VeriSign.

○	The founder is a first time CEO, which makes him liable to make mistakes. The founder will address this weakness by using the resources of MaRS Innovation and continually seeking insight and advice from current CEOs.

Opportunities
○	Fastur will operate in downtown Toronto, considered to be Canada’s startup capital. This location sets Fastur at the centre of Toronto’s burgeoning startup community. This community of developers and entrepreneurs will be invaluable to the initial deployment and product positioning of Fastur. Although the firm will be headquartered in Toronto, the product and its earning potential have a low geographical constraint as it is delivered through the internet and can be purchased anywhere around the world upon release.

○	Fastur takes a new approach to application development and when viewed as a whole, it has no direct competitors. Fastur will capitalize on this technical leadership with aggressive growth in an effort to become every founders must have resource.

○	Fastur aligns well with the technological climate; People want an easier way to build for the digital economy and they want to build applications that can communicate data with real world sensors and machines.

○	Fastur uses a ‘software as a service’ business model which aligns well with the economic climate. The subscription model allows us to grow rapidly while providing individual users with complete autonomy from purchasing, managing and extending the product. Effectively, with this model, Fastur will be able to reach economies of scale while economically benefiting from mass customization.

Threats
○	Fastur faces a risk that current competitors will develop features that are similar to its core value proposition.  For example, WordPress may extend its platform to feature an API console. To overcome this risk, Fastur will develop plugins that adds Fastur to 3rd party applications. 

○	The internet industry is a complex and competitive industry with success rates for start-up business below 10%. We will establish ourselves as a market leader that creates tools that people need to innovate. We will constantly ensure that we are making a product that is needed and by investing in experienced leadership.
