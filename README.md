-  qualia to certainty, increasing certainty to *0 between Q1 and Q2 
-  certainty to knowledge through development of language: language = Q(property) + Q(word(senses)) 
- Building identity from the management of language: Identity = (qualia) + (actions(space(time))) 
- Directing identity towards a goal through spatial representation of value: Directionality = (others you)x(our I) = RO  
- Progress = time(+) = (goal(space(-)) 
- Ego as the propensity for curation of identity toward a single direction: identity + (continual > of spatial ownership) 
- Focus as the biasing of efforts toward attended identity 
- Identity is full reduction of possible states; Identity = Revenue 
- Dreaming as the arranging of (costs) identity in QS: Creating a dream function

## Patent Application
### Business process that operates in a way to increase entropy of identity without negatively effecting profitability or future freedom of action.
- recognition, measurement and maximization of value, by decreasing the distance between objectives that are held within language.  
- Signal Synchronization  Receiving an indication to being sharing data - describing a path traveled by a first device. Receding location data describing the path traveled by the first device. - Transmitting the location data. Placing track location of second device to that of first device. Playing keeping sync.  
1. Receive data describing a path traveled by a second application. 
2. Receive data describing a destination sought by second application. 
3. Receiving current location data of second device.  
4. Demonstrate ownership of information which reduces distance of second device and second devices destination.  
5. Request value for exchange of information.  
6. Patent design for autonomous process control. 
7. Import and analyze language 
8. Identify individuals and intention within language 
9. Determine (spatial) distance between current identities and sought identities  
10. Reduce distance by daydreaming models which when analyzed demonstrate decreases in distances. 
11. Shorten distance to 0 

## Business Summary
Fastur allows clients to build, host and manage internet businesses. The product consists of a content management system, which runs on a web hosting service and features a plug-in architecture for extensions and templates. Fastur.com can be used by anyone with an internet connection and a browser. The problem is that application development is complex and expensive. Designing, developing, and testing an application can have a monthly cost of $30,000 and take 6 months to prepare for launch. Development costs do not end after launching and often increase as business growth necessitates further development. Fastur reduces the time, cost and complexity associated with venture development. Fastur puts the power of artificial intelligence and natural language understanding behind a content management system to become an intelligent website builder. Through our efforts we will set a new standard in venture creation.

## Business Details
Our mission is to enable individuals and organizations throughout the world to realize their full potential by helping them build information driven organizations.

We believe that we will reach our goals by attracting, developing and exciting great people who have a focus on our client’s successes. The development of a useful and reliable dashboard is our key activity. Subscription sales make up our primary revenue stream, incremental revenue will be earned from the sale of themes and extensions in our marketplace

Fastur is incorporated and located in Toronto, Canada.

# Market Research 
## 4.1 - Client Research

Our customers consist of founders and managers of organizations. Fastur is creating value for high growth software companies which are called - startups.

Some startups serve consumer markets while others target enterprise customers. The industries that startups operate in can vary a lot. That being said, the founders of these companies share many of the same problems and the internet products that power their businesses require much of the same in functionality and features.

These founders are our most important customers. They are scattered across the world and tend to live in metropolitan areas. They are supported by Incubators accelerators, co-working spaces and seed-stage Investment firms, all of which tend to be concentrated in downtown metropolitan areas.

Founders attend startup events which bring together entrepreneurs, developers and investors with the goal of cultivating an entrepreneurial culture. These events are the main meeting places for entrepreneurs to gather and share ideas while exposing themselves to people with similar interests.

Our typical customer is computer literate and wants to change the world in a unique way. The problems that these founders have which Fastur could solve are application development, Intelligence delivery and product management.
