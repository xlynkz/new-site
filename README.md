##Product design
- add the following using voice
- reduce the following to essential developer communication
- place else in f/about w associated library(API)function. move biz to public about create new private for strategy

- Opensource index.html
- explain optimizer -> options to set optimizer
- buy leads->Hire sales 
- login shows profile settings (primary address/payment)
- function(text) w leaderboard , github contribution to payment.
- SSL On Fastur.ca @ WeTake.care
- hosted, library and API 
- Algolia on build w confidence
- Hiring of web developer on Upwork to build product
- Consolidate scripts <script>everything</script> +(fastur.ca/smile.js)
- say "show elements": title(default),description(default) payments,cart. move to left. (login to save progress)
- our team: Upwork (can do custom data for enterprise; my focus is scale )
- our technology: stackshare->import(API)->algolia (and the machine reading app thing(later))
- register to save progress + (select account type)
- Regards all information w particular interest for patents, investments and content from thought leaders.  
- external environment to internal mind(all of internet to our local store), Vector space: QS = (Sensor1 + â€¦ Sx)  
- qualia to certainty, increasing certainty to *0 between Q1 and Q2 
- certainty to knowledge through development of language: language = Q(property) + Q(word(senses)) 
- Building identity from the management of language: Identity = (qualia) + (actions(space(time))) 
- Directing identity towards a goal through spatial representation of value: Directionality = (others you)x(our I) = RO  
- Progress = time(+) = (goal(space(-)) 
- Ego as the propensity for curation of identity toward a single direction: identity + (continual > of spatial ownership) 
- Focus as the biasing of efforts toward attended identity 
- Identity is full reduction of possible states; Identity = Revenue 
- Dreaming as the arranging of (costs) identity in QS: Creating a dream function 
- Behaviour  as the development of identities to bias actions 
- ethics(all situations) 
- The above information is incorporated as a user account with administrator privileges, which crawls every page counting settings and performs actions that increase tuple without negative impact on revenue or traffic.

## Patent Application
### Business process which increases entropy of identity without negatively effecting future freedom of action.
- recognition, measurement and maximization of value, by decreasing the distance between objectives that are held within language.  
- Signal Synchronization  Receiving an indication to being sharing data - describing a path traveled by a first device. Receding location data describing the path traveled by the first device. - Transmitting the location data. Placing track location of second device to that of first device. Playing keeping sync.  
1. Receive data describing a path traveled by a second application. 
2. Receive data describing a destination sought by second application. 
3. Receiving current location data of second device.  
4. Demonstrate ownership of information which reduces distance of second device and second devices destination.  
5. Request value for exchange of information.  
6. Patent design for autonomous process control. 
7. Import and analyze language 
8. Identify individuals and intention within language 
9. Determine (spatial) distance between current identities and sought identities  
10. Reduce distance by daydreaming models which when analyzed demonstrate decreases in distances. 
11. Shorten distance to 0 

### Team
- Directorship: Community
- Product Design: Community 
- Advisors: Joseph Mujuzi, Namir(Lab Development), Jamin(language development), Valerie(Incubator Design), Sheldon(partnerships)
- ##Strategy (Be collective, Not linear)
- Franklin Templeton(software for vcs)
- Valerie Fox -> Abdullah Snobar -> DMZ 
- Salim Teja -> MARS
- DMZ -> Futures
- Jonathan Herman -> Geoffery Hinton -> Google
- Albright -> Blackbbery
- Rokk3rlabs 

### Payment
Developers add value and the usage of their addition where it is translatable and measurable to profits is paid to the developer. 

### Aims & Objectives
#### Short Term: 1 week
1. Release Beta (learning)
2. auto generate new identities
3. 5 users

#### Medium Term:  2 Months
1. Partner with local entrepreneurship communities
2. Auto generate patent information
3. Hire for operations and sales
4. Native dashboards for iOS and Android

#### Long Term: 1 year
1. Support for internet connected sensor applications
2. Support for legacy applications and vendors.
3. Support international data systems, languages and currencies.
4. Autonomously consume, integrate and act on information as to build products with an aim for profit.
