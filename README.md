#####Fastur helps clients build self governing products.  
######We deal with data so that founders can focus on creating great experiences. 

We reduce the time, cost and complexity associated with startup development by attracting talented people and exciting them around meaningful projects. 

People want an easier way to build for the digital economy and they want to build organisations that can communicate data with sensors and machines. Our use of programmatic value allows us to grow rapidly while providing individual users with complete autonomy from purchasing, managing and extending the product.

The markets that startups operate in can vary a lot. That being said, the founders of these organisations share many of the same problems and the internet products that power their businesses require much of the same in functionality and features.

Founders can be found anywhere on earth yet tend to live in urban areas. They are supported by incubators, accelerators, co-working spaces and investment firms. These instituions and the general infrastructure required to be competitive tend to be found in cities.

Founders attend events which bring together entrepreneurs, developers and investors with the goal of cultivating an entrepreneurial culture. These events are the main meeting places for entrepreneurs to opportune themselves to people with similar interests.

Our typical client is computer literate and wants to change the world in a unique way. The problems that these founders have which Fastur could solve are application development, Intelligence delivery and product management.

Fastur is built with simplicity as its core experience principle. Users, for example, will not be required to configure their own database or architect their own API instance in order to use Fastur. Technical operations such as these are performed in the background. Clients use Fastur because of its simplicity and power. 

The difference between Fastur and its closest competitors is its focus on the startup market and its obsession with the needs of founders.

We understand that our target audience are people who want to build valuable businesses and often want to change the world in a unique way. They are excited by technology and the possibilities it allows but may not be technically savvy. Our clients do not want to spend time learning how to use Fastur; they want it to just work.

Our clients want a solution that has a transparent cost structure and will allow them to manage their content, data and people from any device that they own.

Fastur is the solution; we sell on the promise that we are an end to end solution for building and managing startups.
