relationships between frequency types by energy lost.
Energy transport by corelation with light.

If you have the two frequencies you can determine the energy change and that will give you the frequency types. 
###Fastur
- Consolidate scripts <script>everything</script> +(fastur.ca/smile.js)
- Implement prose as def!!ault dashboard for Fastur logins. 
- optimize options on product settings
- Extract ideas, products and patents, publications from thought leaders and store w algolia API

##For Researcher 
- external environment to internal mind (all of internet to our local store), Vector space: QS = (Sensor1 + â€¦ Sx)  
- qualia to certainty, increasing certainty to *0 between Q1 and Q2 
- certainty to knowledge through development of language: language = Q(property) + Q(word(senses)) 
- Building identity from the management of language: Identity = (qualia) + (actions(space(time))) 
- Directing identity towards a goal through spatial representation of value: Directionality = (others you)x(our I) = RO  
- Progress = time(+) = (goal(space(-)) 
- Ego as the propensity for curation of identity toward a single direction: identity + (continual > of spatial ownership) 
- Focus as the biasing of efforts toward attended identity 
- Identity is full reduction of possible states; Identity = Revenue 
- Dreaming as the arranging of (costs) identity in QS: Creating a dream function 
- Behaviour as the development of identities to bias actions 
- ethics(all situations) 
- Smile.js as manager of index resources

## Patent Application
### Business process which increases entropy of identity without negatively effecting future freedom of action.
- recognition, measurement and maximization of value, by decreasing the distance between objectives that are held within language.  
- 
- Signal Synchronization  Receiving an indication to being sharing data - describing a path traveled by a first device. Receding location data describing the path traveled by the first device. - Transmitting the location data. Placing track location of second device to that of first device. Playing keeping sync.  
1. Receive data describing a path traveled by a second application. 
2. Receive data describing a destination sought by second application. 
3. Receiving current location data of second device.  
4. Demonstrate ownership of information which reduces distance of second device and second devices destination.  
5. Request value for exchange of information.  
6. Patent design for autonomous process control. 
7. Import and analyze language 
8. Identify individuals and intention within language 
9. Determine (spatial) distance between current identities and sought identities  
10. Reduce distance by daydreaming models which when analyzed demonstrate decreases in distances. 
11. Shorten distance to 0
