For Researcher

-external environment to internal mind (all of internet to our local store), Vector space: QS = (Sensor1 + … Sx)

    qualia to certainty, increasing certainty to *0 between Q1 and Q2
    certainty to knowledge through development of language: language = Q(property) + Q(word(senses))
    Building identity from the management of language: Identity = (qualia) + (actions(space(time)))
    Directing identity towards a goal through spatial representation of value: Directionality = (others you)x(our I) = RO
    Progress = time(+) = (goal(space(-))
    Ego as the propensity for curation of identity toward a single direction: identity + (continual > of spatial ownership)
    Focus as the biasing of efforts toward attended identity
    Identity is full reduction of possible states; Identity = Revenue
    Dreaming as the arranging of (costs) identity in QS: Creating a dream function
    Behaviour as the development of identities to bias actions
    ethics(all situations)
    Smile.js as manager of index resources

Patent Application
Business process which increases entropy of identity without negatively effecting future freedom of action.
- recognition, measurement and maximization of value, by decreasing the distance between objectives that are held within language.

    Signal Synchronization Receiving an indication to being sharing data - describing a path traveled by a first device. Receding location data describing the path traveled by the first device. - Transmitting the location data. Placing track location of second device to that of first device. Playing keeping sync.
    Receive data describing a path traveled by a second application.
    Receive data describing a destination sought by second application.
    Receiving current location data of second device.
    Demonstrate ownership of information which reduces distance of second device and second devices destination.
    Request value for exchange of information.
    Patent design for autonomous process control.
    Import and analyze language
    Identify individuals and intention within language
    Determine (spatial) distance between current identities and sought identities
    Reduce distance by daydreaming models which when analyzed demonstrate decreases in distances.
    Shorten distance to 0


STOFF- Relationships between frequency types by energy lost, Energy transport by correlation with light. (BDAAS) if you have the two frequencies you can determine the energy change and that will give you the frequency types. (Xtime1*Xtime2-cost(X->X))
